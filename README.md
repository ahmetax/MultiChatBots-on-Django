# MULTIBOTS DJANGO PROJECT

In this small Django project with single app, I gathered the links of some  open-source or free to use ai chatbot applications in a single page.

Using the application, it might be easier to compare the answers given to the same prompt by different AI chatbots.

Nowadays, lots of new chatbot applications are shared to the public. You can easily add these to the portfolio.

Also, you can add different types of links to the database.

I will prepare a video about the project, explaining some details.

That project also might be a simple starting point to learn Django.
